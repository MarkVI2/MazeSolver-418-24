# Inspiration
We got inspired by the youtuber, AlphaPhoenix, solving mazes using electricity.

# What it does
The project aims to simulate an electrical circuit based on using Pyspice with ngspice. It figures out the optimal path from origin to destination by assigning each free node as a resistor and figuring out the optimal voltage drop.

# How we built it
We built it using our basic python and flask knowledge, various AI tools and the classic stackoverflow

# Challenges we ran into
Converting the image into a binary img numpy array, the array into the circuit in pyspice, presenting the images on flask framework.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
Successfully creating the circuit associated with a binary array and having a fully functional frontend

# What we learned
We learned that even circuits simulators can be used to figure out the optimal path using a maze

# What's next for MazeSolver 418 24
We plan to scale this up and optimise/cleanup the algorithm such that it produces even more accurate outputs and compile it into a fluid pipeline
